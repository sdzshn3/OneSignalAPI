## Steps to build and run this app
1. This project needs a google-services.json file. So, you might have to create a Firebase app and link it to this app or just remove all SDKs related to Firebase.
2. I have removed 8 string which are ids of OneSignal App Id, Admob App Id, and 6 Ad Unit ids. Either make your own or, remove libraries and code related to OneSignal SDK and Admob
